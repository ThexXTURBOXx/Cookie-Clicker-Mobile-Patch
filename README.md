### DISCLAIMER

### How to Build
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Use apktool to build from the source (apktool and the instructions for how to install it can be found [here](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/))
3. You're done, it's that easy :)

### Features
Major bug fixes:
- Any upgrade can now be used in the permanent upgrade slots.
- Building CPS is now correctly calculated.
- Bug where CPS still exists after all buildings are sold (alpha only).

Additions:
- A wrinkler GUI in the special tab that shows how many active wrinklers you have and the number of cookies you would get from popping them. Also has a button to pop all wrinklers (it wont pop shiny wrinklers).

New settings:
- Short Numbers - Shorten big numbers using english notation (default: on)
- Short Formatting - Shorten the notation of cookies in bank (default: on)
- Spread Wrinklers - Make wrinklers surround the big cookie (default: off)
- Development Tools - Allows for the use of development tools (default: off)
- Auto Golden Cookie Click - Automatically clicks golden cookies and cookie storm cookies (development setting) (default: off)
- Auto Wrath Cookie Click - Automatically clicks wrath cookies and cookie storm cookies (development setting) (default: off)
- Farm Shiny Wrinklers - Automatically pop regular wrinklers while leaving shiny wrinklers (development setting) (default: off)

### Planned Features
- Add a "Round to 3dp" setting, which would allow the user to toggle the rounding of all large numbers between 1 and 3 decimal places.

### Thanks
Thanks to Trixter for allowing this project to use code from his permanent upgrade slot bug fix patch.
